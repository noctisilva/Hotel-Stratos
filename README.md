# Hotel-Stratos
A infrastuctural tool that helps match Venture Capitalists and start-ups.

This is the end of the age of information.
This is the beginning of the age of infrastructure.

Instead of trying to encourage another 19 year old to drop out of college to start an another ephemeral startup,
I decided to help with the infrastructure of the millions of startups to efficiently receive funding and vc's to see where they want to invest in.

So I developed hotelstratos which does just that.

Even though this is a just a prototype, I strongly believe that this will ultimately help with the entreprenuerial infrastructure.

Hosted on Atlantic.net. Used MasterCard API, Yelp, API, and Google Maps API
